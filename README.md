# ShodanCamProject

This project contains a Shodan-based scanner and a simple ML classifier: `shodan_scan.py` connects to the Shodan API, searches for IP camera devices using a query, and writes the results into `data/shodan_results.csv`; `ai_classifier.py` loads that CSV, heuristically labels banners containing camera-related keywords, vectorizes the banner text, trains a RandomForest classifier to distinguish “exposed” vs “benign” devices, prints the model accuracy, and displays a histogram of flagged devices. I removed Markdown fences so the scripts run as Python, installed the required packages in a virtual environment, and — because the provided Shodan key was limited (403 / no query credits) — I added a realistic sample `data/shodan_results.csv` so the classifier and visualization can be tested without Shodan access.

To reproduce: activate the venv, run `python shodan_scan.py` with a paid/unlocked Shodan key to generate live data, then run `python ai_classifier.py` to train and view results.
